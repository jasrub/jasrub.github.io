Hello, my name is Jasmin Rubinovitz. I'm <span class="changing"></span>
<br>
<br>
I'm a cross disciplined researcher, designer and engineer. 
<br>
I love exploring the ways we communicate with people and objects in our surrounding environment. â€¨My work integrates emerging technologies with innovative and experimental user interfaces to create meaningful experiences.
<br>
<br>
I hold a Masters in Media Arts and Science from the MIT Media Lab, where I worked in the Viral
Communications group.
I have B.Sc in Computer Science from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, combined with studies for a B.F.A in Ceramic Design from Bezalel Academy of Art and Design.  
<br>
In the past I worked as a software engineer at Google and as a Lead Creative Technologist at Fake Love, a New York Times Company, where I had the pleasure to work on unconventional immersive experiences for clients such as Nokia Bell Labs, Equinox, State Street Global Advisors, Google and more.
<br> I also thought the wonderful students at the SVA MFACA program.
